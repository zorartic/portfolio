author: ["Zaurayz K. Shah"]
description: "This project explores the design and analysis of a custom adapter plate for Weber carburetors, aimed at improving intake efficiency and overall engine performance. Using flow calculations and modeling, I investigated how tapering, port matching, and geometry adjustments influence velocity profiles and pressure drop across the intake system. The work combines theoretical fluid dynamics with practical engineering, bridging analytical modeling with hands-on automotive innovation."
