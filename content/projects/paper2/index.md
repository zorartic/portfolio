title: "Airflow Bottlenecks and Pressure Losses in Carburetor Conversions: Weber 32/36 DGEV in a Toyota 7K"

description: "This study investigates airflow limitations in a Toyota 7K engine equipped with a stock 4K carburetor and intake manifold. Calculations of volumetric demand and pressure losses demonstrate that the 4K carburetor imposes excessive restriction at higher RPM, justifying the adoption of a Weber 32/36 DGEV carburetor. The focus then shifts to the adapter plate required to mount the Weber, where flow losses are analyzed using contraction coefficients and loss factors for both sharp-step and tapered transitions. Results show that a tapered adapter significantly reduces pressure drop compared to a sharp step, particularly for the secondary bore. The findings establish both the inadequacy of the factory setup and the importance of adapter geometry in realizing the Weber’s potential." 
summary: "This study investigates airflow limitations in a Toyota 7K engine equipped with a stock 4K carburetor and intake manifold. Calculations of volumetric demand and pressure losses demonstrate that the 4K carburetor imposes excessive restriction at higher RPM, justifying the adoption of a Weber 32/36 DGEV carburetor. The focus then shifts to the adapter plate required to mount the Weber, where flow losses are analyzed using contraction coefficients and loss factors for both sharp-step and tapered transitions. Results show that a tapered adapter significantly reduces pressure drop compared to a sharp step, particularly for the secondary bore. The findings establish both the inadequacy of the factory setup and the importance of adapter geometry in realizing the Weber’s potential.

The motivation is two-fold: (i) to achieve practical improvements in airflow and engine performance, and (ii) to apply theoretical knowledge from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics to a real-world engineering problem. The analysis therefore bridges the gap between empirical design practice in automotive modification and academic understanding of internal flow phenomena"
