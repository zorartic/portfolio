##### Abstract

This study investigates airflow limitations in a Toyota 7K engine equipped with a stock 4K carburetor and intake manifold. Calculations of volumetric demand and pressure losses demonstrate that the 4K carburetor imposes excessive restriction at higher RPM, justifying the adoption of a Weber 32/36 DGEV carburetor. The focus then shifts to the adapter plate required to mount the Weber, where flow losses are analyzed using contraction coefficients and loss factors for both sharp-step and tapered transitions. Results show that a tapered adapter significantly reduces pressure drop compared to a sharp step, particularly for the secondary bore. The findings establish both the inadequacy of the factory setup and the importance of adapter geometry in realizing the Weberâ€™s potential.
